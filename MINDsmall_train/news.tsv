N60547	weather	weathertopstories	Waterbomber Fights Emergency Level Blaze Amid 'Catastrophic' Conditions in New South Wales	Several emergency level bushfires were burning on the northern coast of New South Wales in what state officials called a "catastrophic" fire situation on November 12. Out-of-control fires were threatening homes near Kempsey, Tenterfield, Hillville, Nowendoc and Armidale, while two emergency-level blazes were impacting the Clarence Valley. Residents in some of the affected areas were told it was "too late to leave" and to protect themselves "from the heat of the fire" while others were ordered to evacuate immediately. Strong winds were preventing some waterbombers from reaching fires, New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Hot, windy and dry conditions sparked a significant increase in dangerous fire activity across the state's east coast since Friday, November 8. Three people had died and a number were missing while hundreds of properties were damaged as a result of the fires, authorities said. This footage shows a waterbomber dropping its load onto the Gulf Road fire which was burning out of control in the Tenterfield area, near Glen Innes.

"Decided to end our night driving through a #tornado. minor car damage, Sam's a bit disturbed that something so terrifying can happen so quickly like that, and my eardrum hurts soooo bad. Nothing like the pressure… never experienced it before. Thankful God kept us safe," Melissa Korta wrote on Instagram. According to local reports, the tornado damaged structures and caused at least one multi-vehicle collision on the same highway, during which a tractor-trailer overturned onto a passing SUV. The tornado was associated with Post-Tropical Cyclone Nestor, which was downgraded from a tropical cyclone on Saturday afternoon. The storm was expected to turn through Georgia and the Carolinas before heading back towards the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday night.

Whatever happened to the electric bun warmers that Mom and Grandma had? Would a rotary phone even work on the digital infrastructure we have now? (The answer is, "It depends.") While many of yesteryear's biggest hits have disappeared for good, a few are still holding on. For example, wood paneling is actually coming back into fashion in some applications, and vinyl record and Polaroid enthusiasts can still feed their passions with vintage equipment. If you've ever said, "Well, back when I was a kid...," come take a trip down memory lane with us as we visit some of our favorite household blasts from the past.	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/BBWBPAy.html	[]	[{"Label": "Rotary dial", "Type": "C", "WikidataId": "Q668733", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [247], "SurfaceForms": ["rotary phone"]}]

N39708	video	animals	Gigantic bull "moos" his appreciation when he gets his ear scratched	Gus is a 2,000 pound bull who lives on a beautiful farm in Millbrook, Ontario. He is a true gentle giant with a gentle disposition and a friendly nature. He wanders among his herd of cows who are also very happy here on this small chunk of paradise. They have hundreds of acres of lush, green meadow to graze on and ponds full of fresh water to drink. They even have a scratching post with brushes for soothing those itches. Gus is a big boy with big ears and a big itch inside one of them. He patiently waited for his turn at the post while Ethel had a good scratch. When he had the chance, he moved in for some relief. He rubbed his head and his ear and he seemed intent on trying to fit the big brush inside his ear to get at the right spot. Gus' buddy, Dave was watching all of this. Dave had come over for a visit that day, bringing Gus' favorite treat, an entire loaf of bread. Gus had devoured the loaf in under a minute and now he was a happy bull, except of the itch in his ear. Dave watched Gus trying his best to scratch that itch. In fact, the entire herd was gathered around Gus and they watched him as well. Eventually, Dave thought it best to lend a hand. Gus could use a little help from somebody with fingers and thumbs who could do a better job. Not all bulls would allow this, and not all bulls would even permit somebody to get so close to his females, but Gus is as relaxed as a bull can be. Dave walked up and started rubbing Gus' massive ear. Gus obviously appreciated the assistance and he moved his head to make things easier. He let out a few "moos" of contentment and then he wandered away. As Gus takes a few steps away from the brushes, we get a great look at his massive shoulders and rippling muscles. He weighs as much as ten very solid, grown men. Maybe it's because Gus isn't threatened by anything, or maybe it's sheer luck that he's so relaxed, but he doesn't ever react with aggression or hostility. Of course, trying to scratch the ear of a grown bull, or even getting this close to one, is not always wise. Gus is definitely an exception and, even at that, his massive size and strength make him an animal to be respected.	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/AAISKxN.html	[{"Label": "Gigantic (film)", "Type": "W", "WikidataId": "Q3105463", "Confidence": 0.948, "OccurrenceOffsets": [0], "SurfaceForms": ["Gigantic"]}]	[{"Label": "Gus (1976 film)", "Type": "W", "WikidataId": "Q3120992", "Confidence": 0.97, "OccurrenceOffsets": [0, 425, 745, 838, 884, 1001, 1088, 1171, 1377, 1448, 1466, 1621, 1800, 2046], "SurfaceForms": ["Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus"]}, {"Label": "Cavan Monaghan", "Type": "G", "WikidataId": "Q4116647", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [59], "SurfaceForms": ["Millbrook"]}, {"Label": "Ethel, Ontario", "Type": "G", "WikidataId": "Q14875146", "Confidence": 0.999, "OccurrenceOffsets": [542], "SurfaceForms": ["Ethel"]}]
